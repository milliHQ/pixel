# Pixel for Next.js

Pixel is a small wrapper around Next.js which makes the image optimizer available as a standalone service.
This way the image optimizer can be scaled independently from the Next.js server.

## Implementations

- Docker image  
  Coming soon.

- Express/Koa/Fastify middleware  
  Coming soon.

- [AWS Lambda / Terraform](https://github.com/milliHQ/terraform-aws-next-js-image-optimization)  
  For Terraform we provide a full service module that deploys Pixel as an serverless service to AWS.

- AWS Lambda / CDK  
  Coming soon.
